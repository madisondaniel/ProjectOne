# Patient Portal

## Main Goal

Plan, develop, and manage a new patient portal for a small hospital in Missouri to establish a secure line for effective communication. 

## Team Members & Roles

Frances Berghout (Product Owner), Nina Clippard (Developer), Madison Daniel (Developer), Nancy Squellati (Scrum Master)

## Problem

Patients have complained about the challenges in trying to reach out to their providers to discuss their test results and/or ask questions. This consists of lengthy wait times, lack of responsiveness, and the use of medical language in which the patient may not be able to understand. 

## Target Users

The software targets both the providers and the patients. This will be a portal of communication for providers to reach out to their patients, and for patients to ask any questions. Patients can view their appointment notes, test results, and medication lists. 

## High-Level Goals

The main goal is to improve the patient experience with better communication.
